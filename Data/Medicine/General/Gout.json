    "precautions": "\nSevere rashes have been identified in patients receiving allopurinol (Hypersensitivity Syndrome, Stevens-Bohnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). A rash may also include mouth, ears, nose, genital ulcers, and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). These severe rash are often preceded by flu, headache, and body ache symptoms (flu-like symptoms). The rash can lead to widespread bubbing and skin peeling. In Han Chinese, Thai or Korean, these severe skin reactions may be more common.In these patients, chronic kidney disease may increase the risk. Stop taking allopurinol and contact your doctor immediately if you develop a rash or symptoms of this skin.Uritic acid can increase in your urine if you have cancer or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. You have to make sure you drink enough to dilute your urine to stop this.The kidney stones can get smaller and will reach your urinary tract if you have kidney stones.Blood dyscrasies occur more frequently than if these active substances have been administered alone with allopurinol and cytostatics (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, alkyl halogenides).\n",
