These are some of the common symptoms that occur due to the intake of this syrup. It is not necessary that these symptoms will definitely occur to the person taking it.If your doctor has given this drug to you, then keep that in mind that the benefit this medicine going to give you is much more than the loss it is going to give you through its side effects. If the side effects are persistent and the pain is not going for a long time, then must consult your doctor.One thing that one should know is that the medicine containing aluminium can cause constipation as a side effect, and medicine containing magnesium can cause diarrhoea as a side effect. To lessen the chance of constipation, drink a lot of water in your daily routine. Diarrhoea is more likely to happen by taking this medicine.The use of aluminium-containing medicine can cause a decrease in phosphate in the body. This low phosphate in the body can cause tiredness, loss of appetite and muscle weakness. If you feel any of these symptoms contact your physician right away because a decrease in the body's phosphate level can cause a serious problem in your body.Some of the serious side effects of this medicine that require an immediate consultation are black or tarry faeces, breathing rate getting down, heartbeat not regular, mental switches, pain with urination, allergic reactions such as rash, itching especially on the face, throat and tongue and severe dizziness. This is not a complete list of side effects; there are some other side effects that can occur.
